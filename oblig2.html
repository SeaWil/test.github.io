    <p>Min videregående skole var veldig koselig. Den var bygget litt som en labyrint, men man lærte seg fort rutene. Kantinen vår var gjennomsnittelig, men bakgården var bra</p> <!--Paragraph-->

        <p>I went to Arendal high school. It was a worn brick building with very cold rooms. If you ask me the building
        should have been demolished a long time ago. If I have to bring up something positive about the school it would
        have been the canteen. They had good taco baguettes there. </p> <!--"<p>" Defines a paragraph.--> 
            
    
    <h2>Daniel Dalen, 383014</h2> 
        <p>I went to primary school in Kvam, which is also the town where I grew up.
            Compared to other schools I've been to; Kvam has to be the smallest one.
            If I remeber correctly, we were only twentytwo students in my class. We had the same classroom for seven years.
            The classroom was bland and boring. The only colourfull things in our classroom was small art projects.
            Mmm... I guess we filled the walls with memories.
            I wonder how it looks like now.</p>


<h2>Konrad, 383062</h2>
<h3>oh sweet school of mine</h3>
<p>Oh sweet school of mine,</p>
<p>A prison of learning, quite divine</p>
<p>With walls that reach up to the sky,</p>
<p>Confined within, oh what a sigh!</p><br>

Halls like dungeons, cold and bleak
Echoes of footsteps, they speak,
Students in uniforms, rows so neat,
In this "haven," take your seat.

Windows barred, sunlight a rare guest
Metal detectors put us to the test,
Cameras watch our every move,
Ah, the joy this place does prove.</p>
