    <h1>Daniel Dalen, Student id: 383014</h1> <!--Main header-->
    <h2>My school</h2> <!--Second header-->
    <p>I went to primary school in Kvam, which is the town I grew up in.</p><!--Paragraph-->
    <p>Compared to other schools I've been to; Kvam has to be the smallest one.</p> 
    <p>If I remeber correctly, we were only twentytwo students in my class. We had the same classroom for seven years. </p>
    <p>The classroom was bland and boring. The only colourfull things in our classroom was small art projects.</p>
    <p>Mmm... I guess we filled the walls with memories.</p>
    <p>I wonder how it looks like now.</p>
