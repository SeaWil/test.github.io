<p>I went to primary school in Kvam, which is the town I grew up in.<!--Paragraph-->
Compared to other schools I've been to; Kvam has to be the smallest one. 
If I remeber correctly, we were only twentytwo students in my class. We had the same classroom for seven years. 
The classroom was bland and boring. The only colourfull things in our classroom was small art projects.
Mmm... I guess we filled the walls with memories.
I wonder how it looks like now.
