Oh sweet school of mine, <br>
A prison of learning, quite divine,<br>
With walls that reach up to the sky,<br>
Confined within, oh what a sigh! <br>
<br> <br>
Halls like dungeons, cold and bleak,<br>
Echoes of footsteps, they speak,<br>
Students in uniforms, rows so neat,<br>
In this "haven," take your seat. <br>
<br> <br>
Windows barred, sunlight a rare guest, <br>
Metal detectors put us to the test, <br>
Cameras watch our every move, <br>
Ah, the joy this place does prove. <br>
